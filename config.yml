### GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
################################################################################
server:
  # --- GENERIC
  port:
    http: "80"
    https: "443"
  # --- GZIP
  # Automatically enable GZip compression on all requests.
  gzip: false
  # --- TLS
  tls:
    # Automatic Certificate Management Environment
    # Provides automatic generation of SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt
    # and any other ACME-based CA.
    # Default: false (need to provide `certfile` and `keyfile`)
    auto: false
    # Email optionally specifies a contact email address.
    # This is used by CAs, such as Let's Encrypt, to notify about problems with
    # issued certificates.
    email: noreply@example.com
    # Pair or files: the certificate and the key.
    # Used by LoadX509KeyPair to read and parse a public/private key pair from a
    # pair of files. The files must contain PEM encoded data. The certificate
    # file may contain intermediate certificates following the leaf certificate
    # to form a certificate chain.
    certfile: server.pem
    keyfile: server.key
  # --- TIMEOUT
  timeout:
    # It is the maximum duration for reading the entire request, including the
    # body.
    # Because it does not let Handlers make per-request decisions on each
    # request body's acceptable deadline or upload rate, most users will prefer
    # to use `readheader`. It is valid to use them both.
    read: 5s
    # It is the amount of time allowed to read request headers. The connection's
    # read deadline is reset after reading the headers and the Handler can
    # decide what is considered too slow for the body. If it is zero, the value
    # of `read` is used. If both are zero, there is no timeout.
    readheader: 2s
    # It is the maximum duration before timing out writes of the response. It is
    # reset whenever a new request's header is read. Like `read`, it does not
    # let Handlers make decisions on a per-request basis.
    write: 5s
    # It is the maximum amount of time to wait for the next request when
    # keep-alives are enabled. If is zero, the value of `read` is used. If both
    # ara zero, there is no timeout.
    idle: 20s
    # It runs the handler with the given time limit.
    handler: 5s
  # --- FORWARDING
  forwarding:
    # Hostname to be used for requests forwarding.
    host: ~
    # Port to be used for requests forwarding.
    # Default: incoming connection.
    # Values: 80, 443.
    port: 443
    # Endpoint scheme to be used when forwarding traffic.
    # Default: incoming connection.
    # Values: http, https.
    scheme: https
    # List of IPs/Hostnames to be used as load balanced backend servers.
    # They'll be selected using a round robin algorithm.
    endpoints:
    - 127.0.0.1
    # Forces redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.
    # Default: false
    http2https: true
    # Status code to be used when redirecting HTTP to HTTPS.
    # Default: 301
    redirectstatuscode: 301

# --- CACHE
cache:
  # --- REDIS SERVER
  host: localhost
  port: "6379"
  password: ""
  db: 0
  # --- TTL
  # Fallback storage TTL when saving the cache when no header is specified.
  # It follows the order:
  #  - If the cache is shared and the s-maxage response directives present, use
  #    its value, or
  #  - If the max-age response directive is present, use its value, or
  #  - If the Expires response header field is present, use its value minus the
  #    value of the Date response header field, or
  #  - Otherwise, no explicit expiration time is present in the response.
  #    A heuristic freshness lifetime might be applicable.
  # Default: 0
  ttl: 0
  # --- ALLOWED VALUES
  # Allows caching for different response codes.
  # Default: 200, 301, 302
  allowedstatuses:
  - 200
  - 301
  - 302
  # If the client request method is listed in this directive then the response
  # will be cached. "GET" and "HEAD" methods are always added to the list,
  # though it is recommended to specify them explicitly.
  # Default: HEAD, GET
  allowedmethods:
  - HEAD
  - GET
